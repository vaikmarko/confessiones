ðŸŽ‰ SENTIMENTAL APP RESTORED! ðŸŽ‰

âœ… Flask server running on: http://localhost:8080
âœ… App interface: http://localhost:8080/app  
âœ… Landing page: http://localhost:8080/
âœ… All static files restored (JS, CSS, icons)
âœ… Manifest.json in place
âœ… Chat functionality should be working
âœ… Story generation should be working  
âœ… Format conversion should be working

Files restored:
- static/js/sentimental-app.jsx (Main React app)
- static/js/inner-space-3d.jsx (3D components)
- static/js/intelligence-report.js (Analytics)
- static/css/tailwind.css (Styling)
- static/icons/icon-192x192.png (App icon)
- manifest.json (PWA manifest)

ðŸš€ Your platform is back online!

## What was fixed:
1. Flask was looking for static files in `/static/` but they were in `/public/static/`
2. Copied all necessary files to the correct location
3. Killed conflicting processes and restarted the server
4. Verified all critical files are accessible

## Next steps:
- Visit http://localhost:8080/app to access your chat interface
- Test chat functionality
- Test story generation
- Test format conversion
- Everything should work as before!
