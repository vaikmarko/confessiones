gcloud run deploy sentimentalapp-test \
  --source . \
  --region europe-west1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated \
  --set-env-vars OPENAI_API_KEY="$(python3 -c "import os; from dotenv import load_dotenv; load_dotenv('functions/.env'); load_dotenv(); print(os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'))")"

# Deploy hosting
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

## Backend File Structure Update (June 2025)

The Flask backend now **lives only at the project root**‚Äî`app.py` plus the supporting engines (`smart_story_engine.py`, `prompts_engine.py`, etc.).

Previously there was an outdated copy of these files under `public/` used for a Cloud-Functions prototype. Those duplicates have been removed to:

* Prevent accidental imports of incompatible code (they used the new OpenAI 1.x client).
* Keep a single source of truth for the API routes.
* Make navigation and maintenance simpler.

`public/` now contains **only static assets** (HTML, JS, CSS, images, icons).

If you encounter any references to `public/app.py` in deployment scripts, update them to point to the root `app.py`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Front-end Bundle Sync & Deployment Checklist (June 2025)

Sentimental currently ships *two* copies of the main React bundle:

| Location | Used by | When it matters |
|----------|---------|-----------------|
| `static/js/sentimental-app.jsx` | Flask server (local development, Cloud Run) | Authenticated (\`/app\`) traffic routed through the backend |
| `public/static/js/sentimental-app.jsx` | Firebase Hosting | Anonymous visitors and all traffic hitting the root domain (\`sentimentalapp.com\`) |

Because of this split **any UI change must be applied to **both** files** or the live site can get out of sync (e.g. missing tiles, wrong icons).

### Recommended workflow

1. Implement your change in **`static/js/sentimental-app.jsx`** (the copy that hot-reloads locally).
2. Copy it over:
   ```bash
   cp static/js/sentimental-app.jsx public/static/js/sentimental-app.jsx
   ```
   Or create a symlink if you prefer (`ln -sf`)‚Äîjust make sure it ends up in the `public/` folder that Firebase serves.
3. Deploy **Cloud Run** *and* **Firebase Hosting** every time:
   ```bash
   # Backend + /static/js (Flask)
   gcloud run deploy sentimentalapp \
     --source . \
     --region europe-west1 \
     --allow-unauthenticated --quiet

   # Front-end static assets
   firebase deploy --only hosting --project sentimental-f95e6 --non-interactive --force
   ```
4. Verify the version bump: Flask app adds `?v=<timestamp>` to the JS URL, so browsers pull the new bundle automatically; Firebase visitors may need a hard reload only if they were on the site within the last minute of deployment.

> **Long-term fix**: Replace the duplicate file with a single shared build artifact (e.g. Webpack + CI) or serve everything through Cloud Run. Until then, follow the checklist above to avoid "works locally but not in prod" surprises.
