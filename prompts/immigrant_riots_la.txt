I just arrived in LA six months ago and things were finally feeling normal.
The news about the riots downtown is everywhere.
Helicopters kept circling above our apartment last night.
My parents back home are worried sick.
I don't even know which streets to avoid yet.
The grocery store near my work boarded its windows.
Some coworkers are talking about staying home tomorrow.
I feel torn between fear and wanting to witness history.
Police sirens echo through the night nonstop.
Social media is full of conflicting stories.
I saw a smashed bus stop on my walk today.
People are chanting for justice but others are looting.
I'm scared immigration officers will show up in the chaos.
I miss the comfort of familiar places.
Why does starting over have to be so hard?
I dreamed of LA as a safe haven.
Now I'm rationing food in case shops stay closed.
Will the city ever calm down?
I keep asking myself if I made the right decision moving here.
I just needed to share how overwhelming this feels.
