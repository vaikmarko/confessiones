My parents sat us down tonight and said they're separating.
I feel shocked but also kind of numb.
Part of me saw it coming, they've been arguing a lot.
I keep replaying the moment in my head.
I don't know who I'll live with yet.
Mom looked like she was about to cry.
Dad tried to stay strong but his voice cracked.
I'm worried about my little sister, she's only ten.
How do I even tell my friends at school?
I feel guilty for feeling relieved the fighting might stop.
What if holidays are never together again?
I can't focus on homework at all.
I keep wondering if it's somehow my fault.
They said it isn't about us but it's hard to believe.
I don't want to choose sides.
Will we have to sell the house?
Everything feels unstable right now.
I wish they had tried harder to fix things.
I'm scared about what the future looks like.
I just needed to tell someone how confused I am.
