🔥 FIREBASE HOSTING FIXED! 🔥

## Problem Solved ✅

The Firebase hosted version at https://sentimental-f95e6.web.app/app was showing "Sorry, I encountered an error. Please try again." because:

1. **Missing Static Files**: Firebase hosting serves from `/public` directory but static files were in wrong location
2. **Flask Template Syntax**: The HTML files contained Flask template syntax (`{{ url_for() }}`) which doesn't work in static hosting
3. **Relative API Calls**: React components were making calls to `/api/...` but needed to call Cloud Run backend

## What Was Fixed ✅

1. **Created Static HTML Files**:
   - Copied `templates/app.html` → `public/app.html`
   - Copied `templates/index.html` → `public/index.html`
   - Removed Flask template syntax
   - Added API base URL configuration

2. **Updated React Components**:
   - Added `getApiBaseUrl()` function to detect environment
   - Updated ALL API calls to use `${getApiBaseUrl()}/api/...` 
   - Now calls Cloud Run backend when hosted on Firebase

3. **Deployed to Firebase Hosting**:
   - 39 files deployed successfully
   - Static assets properly served
   - API calls now point to Cloud Run backend

## Architecture Overview 🏗️

**Local Development**: 
- Flask serves everything (frontend + backend)
- API calls use relative paths (`/api/...`)

**Production**:
- **Frontend**: Firebase Hosting serves static files
- **Backend**: Cloud Run serves Flask API
- **API calls**: Use full Cloud Run URL (`https://sentimentalapp-319737737925.europe-west1.run.app/api/...`)

## Test Results 🧪

✅ **Local**: http://localhost:8080/app (working)
✅ **Firebase**: https://sentimental-f95e6.web.app/app (now working)
✅ **Cloud Run**: https://sentimentalapp-319737737925.europe-west1.run.app (working)

## Files Modified 📝

- `public/app.html` - Removed Flask syntax, added API config
- `public/static/js/sentimental-app.jsx` - Updated all API calls
- Deployed to Firebase hosting
