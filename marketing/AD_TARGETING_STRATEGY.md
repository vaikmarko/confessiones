✅ **Layer interests:** 3-4 specific interests for precision

❌ **Ignoring exclusions:** Retargeting converters - annoy people
✅ **Exclude converters:** Save budget for new prospects

❌ **Not using behaviors:** Missing high-intent audience
✅ **Add behaviors:** Online shoppers, mobile users, readers

❌ **Static targeting:** Same audience forever
✅ **Dynamic optimization:** Test, scale winners, pause losers

❌ **Geographic too broad:** Global with small budget
✅ **Focus countries:** USA, Canada, UK, Australia first
