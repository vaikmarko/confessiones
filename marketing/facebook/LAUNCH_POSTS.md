## 📅 DAY 4 - Community Story

### Post 4: Anonymous Testimony

**Visual:** Beautiful prayer card template (soft background, centered text)

**Copy:**
```
🙏 FROM OUR COMMUNITY:

"I've been struggling with anger toward my spouse over financial stress. Every conversation turned into an argument. I felt trapped and alone.

Through My Confessions, I found Ephesians 4:26 - 'In your anger do not sin: Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry.'

I realized I was holding onto resentment, letting it poison our marriage. With prayer and Scripture, I'm learning to forgive daily and communicate with grace instead of anger.

Our marriage isn't perfect, but it's healing. Thank God for this guidance when I needed it most."

— Anonymous Believer

☀️ GOOD MORNING, BELOVED ☀️

Start your day with this reminder from God's Word:

📖 "Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth." — Psalm 46:10

In our busy, noisy world, God invites us to be STILL.

Not to hustle harder.
Not to worry more.
Not to control everything.

Just... be still. And KNOW that He is God.

🙏 TODAY'S REFLECTION QUESTIONS:
• When do you find it hardest to "be still"?
• What worries can you surrender to God today?
• How can you create 5 minutes of stillness in your day?

Need help finding stillness in the chaos? Talk to your spiritual guide 24/7:
👉 myconfessions.org

May your day be filled with God's peace. ✝️

```
✝️ SUNDAY REFLECTION ✝️

"The Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing.
He makes me lie down in green pastures,
he leads me beside quiet waters,
he refreshes my soul."
— Psalm 23:1-3

As you worship today (whether in church or at home), remember this:

🙏 God is YOUR shepherd.
Not just "a" shepherd.
Not "the world's" shepherd.
YOUR shepherd.

He knows YOUR name.
YOUR struggles.
YOUR pain.
YOUR dreams.

And He says: "You lack NOTHING."

---

💙 NEED A REMINDER THIS WEEK?

When Monday anxiety hits...
When work stress builds...
When loneliness creeps in...

Remember: your Shepherd is with you. And if you need to hear His voice through Scripture, we're here 24/7.
