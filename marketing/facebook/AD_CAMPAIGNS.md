## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Targeting too broad** - "Everyone who likes Christianity" is too wide  
✅ **Solution:** Layer 3-4 interests, narrow to engaged audiences

❌ **Too many ad variations** - Splits budget, hard to optimize  
✅ **Solution:** Start with 2-3 ads per ad set max

❌ **Not tracking conversions** - You're flying blind  
✅ **Solution:** Install Pixel day 1, track everything

❌ **Giving up too soon** - Ads need time to optimize  
✅ **Solution:** Run for minimum 7 days before deciding

❌ **Ignoring mobile** - 90% of FB users are on mobile  
✅ **Solution:** Design mobile-first, test on phone

❌ **Being too salesy** - Instant turnoff on FB  
✅ **Solution:** Lead with value, compassion, Scripture

## 🎯 TOPIC-SPECIFIC CAMPAIGNS (Advanced Strategy)

### Why Topic-Specific Ads Work Better

Instead of generic "Biblical guidance" ads, create **20 separate ad sets** targeting specific struggles. 

**See:** `marketing/shared/TOPIC_SPECIFIC_ADS.md` for complete ad copy.

### Top 5 Topics to Start With:

1. **Anxiety About Future** - Highest volume, best CTR
2. **Anger in Marriage** - High conversion rate
3. **Depression & Faith Crisis** - Growing audience
4. **Loneliness / Single** - Underserved demographic
5. **Forgiveness Struggle** - Universal pain point

### Implementation:

**Month 1:** Test top 5 topics
- Budget: $2/day per topic = $10/day total
- Run for 7 days
- Measure: CTR, Cost per Lead, Quality of conversations

**Month 2:** Scale top 3, add 5 more topics
- Scale winners: $5/day each
- Test new topics: $2/day each
- Total budget: $25/day

**Month 3:** Full 20-topic approach
- Top performers: $10/day each
- Medium performers: $3/day each
- Low performers: Pause and refine

### Topic-Specific Targeting:

Each topic gets unique audience targeting:

**Anxiety:** Interests: Anxiety relief, Stress management, Mental health
**Marriage:** Interests: Marriage enrichment, Relationship counseling, Married status
**Infertility:** Interests: Fertility, IVF, Pregnancy, Female 90%
**Addiction:** Interests: Addiction recovery, Self-improvement, Male 80%
**Grief:** Interests: Grief support, Hospice, Loss, Ages 40-65

---

**💡 Pro Tip:** Start small ($10/day), learn what works, then scale. Better to spend $300 wisely than $1000 wastefully!

**🙏 May your ads reach thousands seeking God's guidance! ✝️**
