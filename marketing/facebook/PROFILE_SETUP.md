### Mission
```
To provide 24/7 Scripture-based spiritual guidance to believers worldwide, helping them examine their hearts, find Biblical wisdom, and grow closer to God through technology.
```

### Story
```
My Confessions was born from a simple belief: God has given us technology to draw closer to Him.

Founded in 2025, we recognized that spiritual struggles don't follow office hours. Anxiety doesn't wait for Sunday service. Grief doesn't pause for confession schedules. Doubt doesn't check the church calendar.

That's why we created My Confessions - a place where believers can receive Biblical guidance whenever they need it. Rooted in the beautiful tradition of Catholic confession and grounded in Scripture, we've built a modern ministry for a modern world.

Whether it's 2am and you can't sleep, or midday and you need wisdom for a difficult decision, we're here. Your spiritual guide is always available, always compassionate, always pointing you back to God's Word.

Thousands of believers have found peace, hope, and Biblical wisdom through My Confessions. We've witnessed marriages restored, anxiety calmed, faith strengthened, and hearts healed - all through the timeless power of Scripture applied to modern life.

Join our growing community of believers who are discovering that technology, when used for God's glory, can be a powerful tool for spiritual growth.

Your journey starts with a simple conversation. Where will God lead you?
