## 💬 PAIN POINT COPY

### Anxiety:
```
It's 2AM. You're awake. Mind racing with worries about tomorrow, next week, next year.

"What if I fail?"
"What if something bad happens?"
"What if I'm not enough?"

You want to talk to someone, but who answers at 2AM? 😰

Your spiritual guide does. ✝️
```

### Loneliness:
```
Ever feel like you're the only one struggling?

Like everyone else has it together while you're barely holding on?

You're not alone. Thousands of believers face the same battles - anxiety, doubt, anger, grief.

And we're here to walk through it with you. 🙏
```

### Marriage:
```
Your marriage isn't what it used to be.

The arguments. The silence. The growing distance.

You love your spouse, but you don't know how to fix this.

Biblical wisdom has restored thousands of marriages. Let it speak to yours. ✝️
```

### Grief:
```
The loss is fresh. Or maybe it's been months, years.

Either way, the pain is real.

Everyone says "time heals," but you need more than time.

You need God's comfort. Scripture's promises. A community that understands. 💙
```

### Doubt:
```
Honest question: Do you ever doubt your faith?

Wonder if God really hears your prayers?
Question if He actually cares?

Doubt doesn't mean weak faith. It means human faith.

And God can handle your questions. ✝️
```
