## ⚠️ Common Growth Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Spending too much too fast** - Start small, prove ROI, then scale  
❌ **Not tracking metrics** - What you don't measure, you can't improve  
❌ **Ignoring retention** - Getting users is pointless if they don't stay  
❌ **Poor onboarding** - First experience makes or breaks conversion  
❌ **No clear CTA** - Every post/ad needs obvious next step  
❌ **Forgetting existing users** - Easier to retain than acquire new  
❌ **Being too salesy** - Lead with value, money follows  
❌ **Impatience** - Growth compounds, give it 3-6 months
