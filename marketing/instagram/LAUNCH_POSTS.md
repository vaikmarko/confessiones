### Post 5 (2 PM): Community Story

**Visual:** Testimony quote card (soft background, centered text)

**Caption:**
```
💙 FROM OUR COMMUNITY:

"I struggled with anxiety about my kids' safety. Every time they left home, I panicked.

My Confessions helped me find Proverbs 3:5 - 'Trust in the Lord with all your heart.'

I realized I was trying to CONTROL instead of TRUST. I'm learning to release my children to God daily.

The anxiety hasn't disappeared, but I have Biblical tools now. Peace is possible."

### Day 4 - Thursday

**Post 12: Scripture Reflection**

**Visual:** Peaceful water scene + verse

**Caption:**
```
"Why are you cast down, O my soul? Hope in God." — Psalm 42:5

Sometimes the most spiritual thing you can do is preach to your own soul.

When emotions scream lies ("You're alone! God doesn't care! Nothing will change!"), we preach TRUTH:

HOPE. IN. GOD.

Not hope in circumstances changing.
Not hope in your own strength.
Hope in GOD. 🙏

What truth do you need to preach to your soul today?
