# 💰 Instagram Ads - Campaign Strategy

**Platform:** Instagram (via Facebook Ads Manager)  
**Budget:** Alusta $10-20/päev  
**Eesmärk:** Traffic → Signups → Premium conversions  
**Note:** Run Instagram ads THROUGH Facebook Ads Manager (same platform)

---

## 🎯 Instagram vs Facebook Ads

**Instagram Specific Benefits:**
- Younger audience (25-40 vs FB 35-55)
- Higher engagement rates
- More visual, "lifestyle" focused
- Less text tolerance (keep copy shorter)
- Stories ads perform very well
- Reels ads = huge reach potential

**Key Differences:**
- **Visual first:** Image quality matters MORE than Facebook
- **Shorter copy:** 125 characters before "... more" cut
- **Mobile only:** Design for phone screen
- **Stories ads:** Use full vertical format (1080 x 1920)
- **No link previews:** Just image + caption + "Learn More" button

---

## 📊 Campaign Structure (Same as Facebook)

Run ads through **Facebook Ads Manager**, select Instagram placements:

### 3 Main Campaigns:
1. **Awareness** - Reach new Christian audience
2. **Traffic** - Drive to myconfessions.org
3. **Conversions** - Get signups & premium

## 🎯 TOPIC-SPECIFIC INSTAGRAM STRATEGY

### 20 Struggles = 20 Instagram Ad Sets

Generic "Biblical guidance" ads get ignored. **Specific pain points get clicks.**

**See:** `marketing/shared/TOPIC_SPECIFIC_ADS.md` for complete ad copy (all 20 topics).

### Instagram-Optimized Topic Ads:

Each topic gets:
1. **Feed Ad** - Image + headline + first 2 lines of pain point
2. **Stories Ad** - Swipe-up directly to app
3. **Reels Ad** - 15-second video (text overlay + music)

### Top 5 Topics for Instagram (Female-heavy audience):

1. **Anxiety About Future** 🌊 - Universal struggle
2. **Loneliness / Single** 💔 - High engagement rate
3. **Infertility Struggle** 🤱 - Underserved, desperate for support
4. **Depression & Faith Crisis** 🌧️ - Growing conversation
5. **Social Media Envy** 📱 - Meta-irony (Instagram ad about Instagram envy!)

### Visual Strategy Per Topic:

**Anxiety:** Peaceful nature, night scenes, calming colors (blue, purple)  
**Marriage:** Couple imagery (hopeful, not stock-photo-perfect)  
**Grief:** Candles, sunsets, gentle imagery  
**Infertility:** Empty nursery (tasteful), praying hands, hope imagery  
**Addiction:** Chains breaking, sunrise, freedom  

### Caption Formula:

```
[Emotional hook - 1 line]

[Pain point - 2-3 lines]

[Hope statement]

[Scripture verse]

[CTA: Link in bio or Swipe up]

[Hashtags: 10-15 relevant]
```

### Example (Anxiety):

```
It's 2AM. You're awake again. Mind racing. 🌙

"What if I lose everything?"
"What if I'm not enough?"

You don't have to face anxiety alone. ✝️

"Cast all your anxiety on Him because He cares for you." — 1 Peter 5:7
