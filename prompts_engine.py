CONVERSATION:
{conversation}

CONTEXT ABOUT THIS PERSON:
{context_section}

YOUR TASK:
Create a 300-500 word story that:

1. **Sounds Real and Authentic**: Write like a real person telling their story, not like a therapist or novelist

2. **Uses Natural Language**: Speak in the same tone they used - if they were casual, be casual. If they were thoughtful, be thoughtful. Mirror their energy.

3. **Captures Their Voice**: Use language they would actually use. Avoid overly fancy words or concepts.

4. **Focuses on the Human Experience**: What actually happened, how it felt, what they learned - keep it grounded and real

5. **Makes Them the Hero**: Help them see their growth and strength, but in their own words/style

6. **Stays Relatable**: Other people their age should read this and think "I totally get that" or "I've felt that way too"

7. **Only Use Provided Details**: Do NOT add any new events, characters, explanations, or factual details that the user did not explicitly mention in the conversation. If something is unclear or missing, simply omit it rather than inventing or assuming.

WRITING STYLE:
- Write in first person ("I realized..." "I found myself..." "I learned...")
- Use conversational, natural language - NOT poetic or literary
- Include the specific details they shared
- Keep insights simple and authentic, not overly philosophical
- End with something hopeful or forward-looking, but realistic

EXAMPLES OF GOOD TONE:
- "I never thought I'd be the type of person who..."
- "It's funny how you don't realize..."
- "Looking back, I can see that..."
- "I'm starting to understand that..."
- "The thing I'm learning about myself is..."
